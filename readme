These functions provide support for training self driving car models, relying on Keras for training and DonkeyCar for car management / data acquisition.

The main goal of these functions is to provide trained models as hdf5 files for car driving. Training is done on google colaboratory.

Functions include image generator to fit models with on the fly augmentations, 3D image generator to fit 3D convolutions, model explanation using Lime and Keras, and data management.

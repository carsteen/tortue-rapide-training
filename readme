### Torut Rapide Training

This repo provide tools, model, sample data for training self driving cars for Ironcar a model racing cars challenge.

The main goal of these functions is to provide trained models as hdf5 files for car driving. Relying on Keras for training and DonkeyCar for car management and data acquisition. Training is done on google collaboratory, and prediction on the pi.

Functions include image generator to fit models with on the fly augmentations, 3D image generator to fit 3D convolutions, model explanation using Lime and Keras, and data management.
